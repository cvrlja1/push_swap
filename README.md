# push_swap
Push Swap is an algorithmic sorting project from 42 School. It involves sorting a stack of integers using a limited set of stack operations and a second auxiliary stack. The goal is to sort the data with the fewest moves possible, implementing efficient sorting algorithms and optimizing instruction sequences.
